![Pick you door](http://www.coopertoons.com/education/montyhallproblem/montyanddoors.jpg "Montey Hall Problem")

Imagine there are 3 doors in front of you. One of the doors have a great price behind it (like a horse).    
You get the option to choose one of the doors.  
After you have picked your door. One of the other doors is removed. That door does not have the price behind it.   
You now get the option to stick with you original door or choose the other remaining door.


## What do you choose?

**Option 1)** Stay with the same door (This options is normaly what most people would choose) - 33.3% winrate  
**Option 2)** Pick the other door (This option is what you should choose) - 66,6% winrate
  
Option 1 is normaly what most people would choose but the wise thing would actually be to switch door.  

The simple program shows the two different options run for 1000 games each.
